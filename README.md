# Hey, mate!

My name is Henrique Ramos, I'm 21 and I live in [Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/ydd9TSyMcLFzpgbv9). I'm a Software Engineering undergraduate at PUC Minas and a Front-end developer. In my spare time, I like to play Dota 2, read about UI/UX Design (Which, in my opinion, is an important trait for a Front-end dev) and about new community trends and sometimes I write articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to/hnrq). I want to become a Creative Developer someday, so I'm currently studying WebGL, Three.js and 3D modeling on Blender (And voxel art on MagicaVoxel).

## My Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c9cb4ce1-e706-454b-8169-d52fb4719e59/deploy-status)](https://hnrq.dev/)

My personal website is [hnrq.dev](https://hnrq.dev). The idea behind it was to impress my personality on it: I'm a sink or swim and very literal person, and that's why I used only black and white and no images at all (Even the icosahedron is made of ASCII characters).

## Notable repos

### [TEMPO1984](https://github.com/hnrq/TEMPO1984)
This one is my favorite by far. It was a task for the Human Computer Interaction college subject, that was about making a website based on a song. Then, I created [TEMPO1984](https://hnrq.github.io/TEMPO1984): A website based on Macintosh 3.1's design. It was a tough job, because it involved making the icons and bars as SVGs in Illustrator, searching for the font used in it and much more. However, I think it looks really nice!

### [framer-motion-tryout](https://github.com/hnrq/framer-motion-tryout)
This was a small experiment using framer motion to test route transitions. I created a small image searcher (Using Intersection Observer for the infinite scroll) and a master detail modal route, you can check the live demo [here](https://hnrq.github.io/framer-motion-tryout/).

### [Workout](https://github.com/hnrq/workout)
Workout is a native Android app, built using Java. It is supposed to be an app to help keeping track of your exercise charts, you can create, edit, delete and share them through links or QR code with other people. This is a very nice project that I intend to remake it using Flutter in the future.

### [rich-text-editor](https://github.com/hnrq/rich-text-editor)
This is a test of two of the most popular rich text editor frameworks: Slate.js and Draft.js. The result can be seen [here](https://slate-editor.herokuapp.com/#/slate).
